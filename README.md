Has the File Lister to list all files/directories in a given directory/folder
Has the File Appender where it can append text to a file or creat a file then append text to it if it doesnt exist
Has the Character Checker that reads a file character by character to be able to count the number of times a user specified character appears
I learned how to read a file character by character using a FileInputStream
